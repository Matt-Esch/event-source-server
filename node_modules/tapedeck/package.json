[OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  -w, --watch                 watch mode       \n  -h, --html                  html reporter\n  -p, --phantom, --phantomjs  test headlessly with phantomjs\n```\n\n### normal mode\n\ntapedeck asks you to open your browser, executes the tests with output on your\nconsole and exits with the proper exit code after the tests are run.\n\n```bash\n$ tapedeck test.js\nOpen up http://localhost:13379 in your browser\n\nTAP version 13\n# editable\nok 1 input changed\nok 2 stream received data\nok 3 el changed\n\n1..3\n# tests 3\n# pass  3\n\n# ok \n\n$ echo $?\n0\n```\n\n### watch mode\n\ntapedeck keeps the session open and reruns the tests whenever a file changes,\nthanks to browserify's magic watch powers.\n\n```bash\n$ tapedeck test/*.js -w\nOpen up http://localhost:34264 in your browser\n\nTAP version 13\n# editable\nok 1 input changed\nnot ok 2 stream received data\n  ---\n    operator: equal\n    expected: \"it changed\"\n    actual:   false\n  ...\nok 3 el changed\n\n1..3\n# tests 3\n# pass  2\n# fail  1\nTAP version 13\n# editable\nok 1 input changed\nok 2 stream received data\nok 3 el changed\n\n1..3\n# tests 3\n# pass  3\n\n# ok \n```\n\n### phantomjs\n\nBRAND NEW: use phantomjs to run you tests headlessly. This way you don't need\nto open a browser, phantomjs does all that for you.\n\n```bash\n$ tapedeck test/*.js -p\nTAP version 13\n# editable\nok 1 input changed\nok 2 stream received data\nok 3 el changed\n\n1..3\n# tests 3\n# pass  3\n\n# ok \n```\n\nCombine with `watch` for super powers!\n\n### html reporter\n\nShows the tests output directly in your browser. Use with caution, this may\nbreak some tests that do DOM stuff like `document.querySelector('pre')`.\nOne `<pre>` is inserted in the body.\n\nCombine with `watch` for super powers!\n\n```bash\n$ tapedeck test.js --html\nOpen up http://localhost:22804 in your browser\n```\n\n![html reporter](http://i.imgur.com/TDC8c.png)\n\n## installation\n\n```bash\n$ sudo npm install -g tapedeck\n```\n\n## license\n\n(MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 &lt;julian@juliangruber.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
